ofxGLM - Blender exporter
=========================
A slightly modified version of the blender .obj file exporter which only uses 
the name of the models (not also vertices) and sets all options default to 
the ones needed by ofxGLM.

Install the script
===================
- right click the blender app
- "Browse package contents > MacOS > 2.5x > scripts > op "
- copy paste the diretory io_obj_scene_ofxGLM there
